# Machine Learning Algorithms Study

## Overview

This project is dedicated to studying and understanding various types of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. We explore different approaches, implementations, and use cases to gain a comprehensive understanding of ML techniques.

Topics Covered

We study the following types of ML algorithms:

1. Supervised Learning

- Linear Regression

- Logistic Regression

- Decision Trees

- Random Forest

- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

Neural Networks

2. Unsupervised Learning

- K-Means Clustering

- Hierarchical Clustering

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

- Autoencoders



3. Ensemble Learning

- Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)

- Boosting (AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost)

- Stacking

## Objectives

- Learn and implement various ML algorithms.

- Understand their theoretical foundations and practical applications.

- Compare different algorithms based on performance and use cases.

- Work with real-world datasets for hands-on practice.

## Requirements

- Python (3.x)

- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

- Scikit-Learn

- Jupyter Notebook (recommended for experiments)

# Installation

To set up the environment, run:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow torch jupyter
